DATASET<br>
The dermatoscopic images from different populations, acquired and stored by different modalities.
The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images
Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions: 
<ul>
    <li>Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec),</li>
    <li>basal cell carcinoma (bcc),</li>
    <li>benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl), </li>
    <li>dermatofibroma (df), </li>
    <li>melanoma (mel),</li>
    <li>melanocytic nevi (nv) and vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).</li>
</ul>

This repository contains the code for classification of pigmented skin lesions,<br>
Convolutional neural netwwork and some other pretrained models for classification are built and implemented in pytorch
